A project for detecting suspicious activity and objects using machine learning techniques.
# Suspicious Activity and Object Detection

This project demonstrates a basic approach to detect objects and suspicious activities using computer vision techniques. 

## Features:
- Object detection using pre-trained models like Haar Cascades.
- Motion detection for identifying suspicious activities in video footage.
